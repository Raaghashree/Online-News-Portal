# Online-News-Portal

In the modern age of information, a robust and efficient online news portal system is essential
for disseminating accurate and timely news to the public. With the growing reliance on digital
news platforms, it is crucial to design a system that can handle a wide variety of content
types, maintain data integrity, and ensure user satisfaction. This project aims to develop a
comprehensive online news portal system with relations encompassing user details, login,
permissions, roles, articles, advertisements, categories, breaking news, subscriptions,
subscribers, transactions, editors, and authors. By leveraging modern technologies and best

practices in software development, this project aims to deliver a scalable, reliable, and user-
centric online news portal system that meets the evolving needs of today's digital audience.

Through continuous iteration and refinement, the system will strive to uphold journalistic
integrity, promote informed discourse, and contribute to a well-informed and engaged society.
